# FunBlocks
A functional block based programming language for CodeWorld.
The language will feature a visual block-based UI with a code generator that outputs a subset of Haskell in order to create CodeWorld applications.

## Notes
### Type Checking
[Typing Haskell in Haskell](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/thih/) - Haskell type checking
[Hint](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hint-0.5.2) - Type-check and evaluate strings with Haskell expressions and even coerce them into values.
[Programming language](http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Books/ProgLangs/2007-04-26/) - Programming languages, covers Racket, has got a chapter on type checking
[The Implementation of Functional Programming Languages](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/slpj-book-1987/) - Contains a chapter on Polymorphic type checking
[Baskell](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/baskell) - A small functional language featuring type inference.
